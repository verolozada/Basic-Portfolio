    <p>My name is Veronica Lozada, I'm 22 years old. I'm from Caracas, Venezuela and recently move to Atlanta looking for a change and to have new experiences, looking for personal and professional growth. I just graduated from Industrial Engineering in my hometown. I had the opportunity to live in Barcelona for a year as an exchange student and has been one of the best experiences in my life, getting to know people from all over the world and live in a different culture than mine. I love to travel and meet new places everytime I can. </p>
